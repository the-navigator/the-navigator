# Konichiwazzup!

This accound is owned by three high-school students who are working on open-source software to contribute possible solutions to educational problems in the system.

## ðŸ•µ The team is currently working on its pioneer project: Libre.
- ðŸ“šLibre is an open-source ***flexible digital library*** software.
- :laptop: It was originally called "The Navigator"(hence our username).
- We have written its full software using .NET C# in Visual Studio.
- ðŸ“ƒThe project is copyrighted under *Philippine National Library* as of 2019.

Well It started as a research project and we are determined to release it globally. We are thriving to do our best to meet the competencies of this modern software age by making the program as engaging and easy-to-use as possible while also having great features.

We are looking for contributions as we are, as of now, amateurs and are only at the surface level of programming.
We thank you for taking time to visit us!
