# Konichiwazzup!

This accound is owned by three high-school students who are working on open-source software to contribute possible solutions to educational problems in the system.

## ðŸ•µ The team is currently working on its pioneer project: Libre.
- ðŸ“šLibre is an open-source ***flexible digital library***
- We are looking for contributions as we are, as of now, amateurs and are only at the surface level of programming.
- We thank you for taking time to visit us!
